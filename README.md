## Creative Coding (DM-GY 6063) - Programming: Week 13

### Description of Logic
- After going through our assignments, I found HW03A would be a nice canvas to improve on using the Arduino.
- I used a potentiometer to control the size of the bigger circles, and a LDR for the size of the smaller circles.
- The sizes are directly proportional to the values that p5.js receives from Arduino. As the values increase and decrease, so do the size of the circles. When the values read 0, the circles return to their original sizes.
- I applied the Exclusion blending mode to the bigger circles so that when they overlap with the smaller ones, the overlapped areas turn black and white.
